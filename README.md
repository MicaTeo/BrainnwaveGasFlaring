# Brainnwave Gas Flaring: Identifying Locations  

**Background** 
- Oil and Gas production sites flare (i.e. burn) excess gas when storing or processing is not economically viable
- Excessive waste of resources
- C02- Emissions
- Companies tend to not report flaring volumes

**Goals of the project**
- Identify data sources that relate to gas flaring 
- Use available data to determine global flaring locations 
- Approximate the amount of gas flared at each location over time

**Datset**
- VNF dataset: Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) dataset from the Suomi National Polar Partnership (SNPP) satellite, launched in 2011;
- OpenStreetMap dataset
